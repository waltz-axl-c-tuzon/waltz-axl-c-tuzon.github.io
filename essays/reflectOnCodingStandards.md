<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Having the requirement to code a certain way just for the sake of implementing “software engineering techniques” and “improving the quality” of the code, will divide a population of coders. Of course there are those who will say that the standard for coding should be followed because there are rules that need to be checked, then there are also those who want to continue typing their code by the way that they learned coding. I will be siding with the populous that wants to enforce coding standards and how it will benefit you in the future, then I will transition to the opposite populous and why they should try changing, even if it is little by little.</p>
<h2>It’s Like Learning to Walk Again</h2>
<p>Change… change is good. Changing the way that you code in the standard way can grant readability and professionalism not only to yourself, but to others viewing your work who also happen to follow the coding style that is standardized. Changing from one way of writing to another is like learning the same language but with just a different way of word ordering, or learning to walk again after an accident or something. Failing is inevitable, but it’s still a change. I know that I still fail in following the most simple coding styles like having to put a newline at the very end of the code, using single quotes instead of double quotes, using the keyword var instead of let and const, but that won’t stop me from changing. You do not need to remember all of them, you can always refer back to the coding style guide if you forgot how to or if you think that you are doing something wrong, that is how you can truly change.</p>
<h2>Staying Still Will Only Make Your Life Worse Off</h2>
<p>I was once a person who was a part of the population that did not follow coding standards, but a consideration to think about is how people will read your hard work or even people who you are working with on the same project. It’s like having the same handwriting as your kindergarten self, it’s all a mess but the effort is there though effort can get you so far. People, like your boss, will have a hard time looking at your work because of how you put things together, like submitting a written report where you used your left hand even though you are right hand dominant, and vice versa. As little as structuring and commenting on your code can guide readers to know what it is that your code is doing. A little change is still a form of change.</p>
<h2>Final Words…</h2>
<p>Before I leave, I just want to let you know that I am not forcing others to follow the same coding style that we are supposed to do, you can do whatever you want with your code, it’s your work, your masterpiece. Something that you should consider is that you should follow the standard style if you are working with other people on a project, putting your code on your resume or website, turning in your work to your professor or boss, etc. so that you will look professional.</p>
