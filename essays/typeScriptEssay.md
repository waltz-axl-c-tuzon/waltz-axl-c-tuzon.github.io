Ever since the entire class was being self taught with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while maintaining the pace of our Software Engineering course, ICS 314, I thought that was all that we needed to learn to get through this class. Having to do a lot of coding homework was what I was expecting in this class because we were told to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before the semester even started. We were told to learn these coding languages and more for this course and that we are required to be proficient in them especially when we are doing WODs, short for Workout Of the Day. TypeScript was the language that we were set to learn and use, right after learning JavaScript.
	JavaScript was not that bad because I learned Java as my first coding language, and although they are both completely different languages, I did manage to learn the syntax and rules of JavaScript, what makes pieces of the code work and what does not. Although it took me a while to get used to it and having to relearn things that I should not have forgotten from my past coding classes like Java, Python, C, and C++, I was overwhelmed with how I would perform in TypeScript as it is said to be a superset of JavaScript, and so I was guessing that I needed to be having  more than average proficiency at JavaScript. 
	Right after finishing up the Learn JavaScript course from codecademy and the provided exercises on FreeCodeCamp, I felt ready to learn TypeScript. To my surprise, TypeScript is not as bad as I thought it would be. My initial thoughts were that it would be as complex as C and C++, but in reality TypeScript was just about the same as JavaScript with just the difference being that TypeScript has more features than JavaScript. The added features were basically everything that JavaScript lacked: having strict variables where once a variable is initialized it will always be that type, it can always infer the type without being explicitly written, and much more. I also learned the union type which I found interesting because it makes the variable choose what data type value it can hold without giving any errors. As I read through FreeCodeCamp’s guided TypeScript tutorial, I noticed that classes, interfaces, and a lot of important topics in coding, as far as I know, were not introduced in any part of the JavaScript course from codecademy, fortunately TypeScript has that all covered and will be deemed helpful as the weeks progress in this course.
	Moving forward to when I was announced to turn in a WOD where I needed to code in TypeScript, I was immediately able to complete them in less than the required average time of the WODs completion, which in turn helped me with developing this pedagogy called Athletic Software Engineering that acquires software engineering skills through time constraints, high intensity, and stress inducing approaches, and I plan on keeping it that way as I continue to be more proficient in software engineering by tackling WOD prompts, and even contributing in assignments and projects. Learning TypeScript was more of a breeze to me right after learning JavaScript because of the similarities and a few things that I needed to keep in mind when I code in TypeScript. Overall, I find TypeScript to be a fundamental language to have knowledge of even though it is our first time learning a coding language or that you already have a favorite language you use, it’s not always a bad idea to know more in case when needed.
