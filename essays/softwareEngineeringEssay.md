<p>Before I begin with how my interests in Software Engineering emerged, I have to first start off with where it all began. Ever since I was introduced to video games such as Halo, Tekken 6, GTA: San Andreas, SSX Tricky, Metal Slug, and others more from the original XBox to the PS3, I grew an interest in video game development because I could not stop playing for hours then on. Fast forward to when I started college, I planned out all of my courses to best fit in a category of what I would need to help me produce my own game or games like ICS 485 which is a Video Game Design course, ICS 486, a Virtual & Augmented Reality Prog course, and the like that would get me to reach my goals. Since they did not have a degree pathway for that at that time, I signed up for the Creative Computational Media certificate, CCM for short, and took the Video Game Designer/Developer/Animator pathway. </p>
<p>Over the course of my sophomore year and during Fall 2023 semester, we had a meeting with our department counselors as well as with other students to reflect on our journey through college and I remembered them saying that a new pathway was underway of being added, which was the Creative Computational Track, but at that time I already began to grow interests in cybersecurity and digital forensics due to the field becoming more demanding as technology evolves. I met up with my counselor so that I could fill up forms to be admitted to either of the departmentâ€™s track programs, and I made up my mind to choose the B.S. Security Science Track and continue to also pursue the CCM certificate. I chose the Security Science pathway because, as cliche as it sounds, I want to protect and prevent everyone from cyberthreats and cybercrimes.</p>
<p>Lastly, as I am taking the ICS 314 Software Engineering course in my 3rd year of college because I also grew an interest within this field. I grew an interest in this course because it involves a lot of coding, taking on responsibility, learning to work under pressure, having the ability to write up reports/essays and type in codes for a solution to problems given, as well as building up my professional persona. Software engineering to me is a fundamental skill to learn as I continue to tread for my Computer Science journey. As I am in this journey chapter of garnering more knowledge of Software Engineering, I hope to be more proficient in coding, able to learn more codes, and learn many more fundamental skills as time goes by.</p>
