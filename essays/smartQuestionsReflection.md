<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>In the world of coding, or hacking whichever you prefer, there is a standard for which one asks a question, or multiple questions, the “smart way.” It is best to assume that everybody is busy, and that answering your questions would mean that they sacrificed a portion of their time to help you rather than using it for themselves. There are also those that have the answers but rather not give it to you, and they have a good reason for it. Asking a question that could have been easily looked up online, or a question so obvious would leave your question gaining dust, and asking a question like that would be seen as incompetent and rude to them. Might I remind you that they are busy people and would rather spend their time answering a question that shows competence and quality over something basic. In a sense, you will only get the help you need once you have tried all possible solutions and provided a thorough walkthrough of what you’ve done so far such as reading and trying out the solutions from archived forums, skimmed or read a manual or manuals, reviewing your work incase you have messed up the syntax, and the like so that other hackers know that you have done your part in finding the solution rather than using their time only for you to not take anything from their help after being given.</p>
<h2>What Makes a Question Smart?</h2>
	<p>An example of a smart question is by a StackOverflow user, Fausto A. A. Barbuto, who asked a question regarding his problem with the title “OpenMP's OMP_SET_NUM_THREADS() not working as expected.” What constitutes this as a smart question is that he first stated that his knowledge of OpenMP is superficial, which is very important because in the world of hacking, you are assumed to know what you’re talking about. He also stated that he recapped old concepts he learned and downloaded some materials with theory and examples, which show that he wants to learn rather than just wanting answers from his question. He provided snippets of codes as well as tried to also implement his own input but it prompted with a “!$Call OMP_SET_NUM_THREADS()” and knowing that it should not output the value wrong based on what he’s done in the past. He also said that he looked up solutions to his problem but to no avail, it still did not work. He also asked for guidance on what to do, again indicating that he wants to find the solution rather than get the solution from the more experienced hackers. Finally, he provided information on what operating systems he uses which is also helpful as it gives more information for the hackers to help the user.</p>
<h2>What Makes a Question Not Smart?</h2>
	<p>As you may have guessed, it is a question that does not seem to be wanting to gain knowledge, a question that only seeks help in a lazy way. An example of a “not so smart question” is from a user named Michael Gundlach, who asked the question “Can comments be used in JSON?” The description of the question is just a single question, asking how to comment inside a .JSON file. This person would be described as a lazy user who wants others to work for him rather than doing the work himself. The question itself could have been Googled easily or be read through a manual.</p>
<h2>To Summarize…</h2>
	<p>To summarize what the difference is between the two is that one shows effort while the other one does not. Hackers appreciate it when a question is asked after the fact that the person who asked the question did try something that would solve their problem but still failed, whereas a question that does little to no effort when it can be looked up in the web easily is typically avoided and not responded. Hackers also appreciate it when the user who asks questions wants to learn something rather than a user who asks a question only wants answers and nothing more. To end it off: always put in effort to your question or questions before letting someone sacrifice their time, the quality of the question and its description is what will get you the help you need.</p>
