Polymorphism (C++) is a code that that introduces... polymorphism, which is dynamic binding.  

I am using this multiline comment from my code to have you get a better understanding of what this assignment is about.
```c
/**
 *Polymorphism (dynamic binding) is introduced, which is the ability of objects of 
 * different classes related by inheritance to respond differently to the same member 
 * function call. Polymorphism is made possible through class inheritance from a base 
 * class or from a derived class, overriding member functions, virtual member functions,
 * pointers, and dynamic binding.
 *
 */
```

This assignment was all done by myself. This project taught me about polymorphism, inheritance, and ponters. It took me a while to get a hold of C++ pointers, but I managed to understand it through YouTube tutorials and reading and watching the Professor's lecture videos.

Here is the class hierarchy diagram of the code's polyomrphism:

```c
/**
 * Class hierarchy:
 *                     Shape
 *                   /   |   \
 *                  /  Square \
 *                 /     |     \
 *                /     Cube  Triangle
 *             Circle            \
 *             /    \        Tetrahedron
 *            /      \
 *        Sphere   Cylinder
