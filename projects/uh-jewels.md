UH-Jewels is a final project that [Jarren Seson](https://github.com/jarrenseson), [Katelyn Sung](https://github.com/katelynsung), and [I](https://github.com/waltz-axl-c-tuzon) worked on that involves the use TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, NextJS, Bootstrap-React, and PostgreSQL. My contribution to the project was making the navbar page, navbar links to direct to its respective pages, billing page, order page, making sure that only people that are logged in can access the website, and buttons that link to certain pages like cart page has a button that links to the billing page and billing page has a button that connects to the shipping form page.

Some more contributions that I made were proposing minimal changes like making the website as neat as possible and not having a huge empty whitespace around it and some website bug fixes.
